Postmortem Project 









SUMMARY OF THE INCIDENT*

 **Duration:** The outage lasted approximately 4 hours, from 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM (GMT).
 **Impact:** The service experienced intermittent disruptions, leading to slow response times and partial unavailability. Approximately 30% of users were affected, reporting difficulty in accessing certain features and content.



**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the outage was identified as a database connection bottleneck due to a sudden spike in traffic coupled with inefficient query execution.

*Timeline:***

- **9:00 AM:** The issue was detected through monitoring alerts indicating a significant increase in response times.
- **10:15 AM:** Engineers investigated potential causes, focusing initially on network infrastructure and application code.
- **11:00 AM:** Misleading assumptions led to exploration of external API dependencies, diverting attention from the actual bottleneck.
- **11:30 AM:** As the issue persisted, the incident was escalated to the database administration team for further analysis.
- **12:00 PM:** Database administrators identified a high volume of concurrent queries overwhelming the database server.
- **1:00 PM:** Implementing temporary optimizations to alleviate the bottleneck, engineers gradually restored service functionality.
- **2:00 PM:** The issue was fully resolved as database resources were optimized to handle increased traffic efficiently.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

The root cause of the outage was traced to inefficient database query execution and limited connection pool capacity. Queries were not optimised for performance, leading to prolonged execution times and resource contention. Additionally, the database connection pool was inadequately sized to accommodate the sudden influx of user requests.

To address the issue, database queries were optimised for efficiency, including index optimization and query caching strategies. Furthermore, the database connection pool size was increased to adequately handle concurrent connections during peak traffic periods.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

- **Regular Review of Infrastructure:** Conduct regular reviews of the infrastructure stack to identify potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization.
  
- **Implement Automated Scaling:** Utilise auto-scaling mechanisms to dynamically adjust resources based on traffic patterns, ensuring optimal performance during peak loads without manual intervention.
  
- **Enhance Logging and Monitoring:** Improve logging and monitoring capabilities to provide deeper insights into system behaviour and facilitate quicker detection and resolution of issues.
  
- **Implement Redundancy and Failover:** Introduce redundancy and failover mechanisms across critical components to mitigate the impact of single points of failure and improve system resilience.
  
- **Continuous Performance Testing:** Implement continuous performance testing strategies to proactively identify performance degradation and scalability limitations before they impact users.
  
- **Regular Training and Knowledge Sharing:** Provide regular training sessions and promote knowledge sharing among engineering teams to ensure awareness of best practices and emerging technologies in web stack development and debugging.
  
- **Documentation and Incident Response Plans:** Maintain comprehensive documentation of system architecture, configurations, and incident response procedures to facilitate efficient resolution of future incidents and minimize downtime.
  
- **Implement Chaos Engineering Practices:** Embrace chaos engineering principles to deliberately introduce failures into the system and validate its resilience under adverse conditions, thereby identifying and addressing weak points in the infrastructure stack.

**Tasks:**

1. Conduct quarterly infrastructure reviews to identify performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.
2. Implement auto-scaling mechanisms across critical components to adapt to fluctuating traffic patterns automatically.
3. Enhance logging and monitoring infrastructure to provide real-time visibility into system health and performance metrics.
4. Introduce redundancy and failover mechanisms for key services to improve fault tolerance.
5. Incorporate continuous performance testing into the development pipeline to identify scalability issues early in the development lifecycle.
6. Schedule regular training sessions and knowledge-sharing workshops to foster a culture of continuous learning and improvement among engineering teams.
7. Document incident response procedures and update them regularly based on lessons learned from past incidents.
8. Introduce chaos engineering experiments to validate system resilience and identify areas for improvement in the infrastructure stack.

By implementing these corrective and preventative measures and addressing the identified tasks, we aim to enhance the reliability, scalability, and resilience of our web stack, ensuring uninterrupted service delivery and a seamless user experience.
